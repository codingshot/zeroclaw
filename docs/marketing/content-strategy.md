| **Edge AI** | Run AI on $10 hardware, <5MB RAM | “ZeroClaw on Raspberry Pi,” “AI without the cloud” | Makers, IoT, robotics |
| **Comparison** | ZeroClaw vs X | Comparison pages, benchmark deep-dives | Evaluators, Reddit, SEO |
| **How-to / Build** | Step-by-step tutorials | “15-min RPi setup,” “Add a GPIO tool” | Makers, students |
| **Architecture** | Trait system, extensibility | “Why Rust for agents,” “Memory without Pinecone” | Rust devs, SRE |
| **Enterprise** | Security, audit, compliance | Pairing, sandbox, RBAC, SOC 2 / HIPAA | Ops, enterprise CTOs |
| **Health / Legal / IoT** | Vertical use cases | HIPAA checklist, legal RAG, smart glasses | Health tech, legal, wearables |
| **Community** | Ecosystem, contributors, hackathon | Showcase projects, PR spotlights | Builders, sponsors |

## Cadence (Suggested)

- **Blog / landing:** 1–2 posts per month (comparisons, how-tos, architecture).
- **Reddit:** 1–2 organic posts per week across subreddits (see [reddit-outreach.md](reddit-outreach.md)).
- **Twitter/X:** 3–5 posts per week (tips, benchmarks, retweets, replies).
- **YouTube:** 1 video per month (tutorial, demo, “ZeroClaw on RPi in 15 min”).

---

## SEO & AI Search

- Landing comparison pages (`/compare/zeroclaw-vs-*.html`) for “ZeroClaw vs X” queries.
- FAQ schema and direct answers for AI/Perplexity-style search.
- Target long-tail: “AI on Raspberry Pi,” “lightweight AI agent runtime,” “Rust autonomous agent.”
