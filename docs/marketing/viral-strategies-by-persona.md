## 1. Rust Ruth

**Viral appeal:** Code purity, trait design, mergeable PR, “real” engineering.

**Best viral ideas:**
- “Show HN: trait-based AI agent runtime in Rust”
- Architecture deep-dive post (trait diagram, factory pattern)
- “One PR to add a Provider” — minimal, satisfying
- “Clippy clean, 0 unsafe” — quality flex
- “Rust vs TypeScript for AI agents” — debate bait

**Formats:** Long-form post, code snippet, trait diagram, PR screenshot.

**Channels:** r/rust (show-and-tell), Hacker News, Rust Discord, Rust users forum.

**Strategy:**
- Lead with code, not marketing. Show the trait, not the pitch.
- “Extend in a weekend” — achievable, concrete.
- Avoid “AI” hype; emphasize architecture, contracts, CONTRIBUTING.

**Don’t:** Over-sell AI; use vague claims; ignore code quality.

---

## 2. Maker Max

**Viral appeal:** Cheap hardware, physical control, “I built that,” surprise at specs.

**Best viral ideas:**
- “$10 board challenge” — run on cheapest board
- “Telegram → blink LED” — 60s video

- “First AI on [obscure device]”
- “I ran an AI assistant on a $10 board” — Reddit post + photo
- “Smallest runtime” leaderboard
- Live install on Twitch — unknown Pi, 15 min

**Formats:** Video (60–90s), photo of setup, benchmark screenshot, unboxing.

**Channels:** r/raspberry_pi, r/arduino, maker Discord, Hackaday, YouTube (maker).

**Strategy:**
- Visual first. Show the board, show the blink.
- “$10” and “<5MB” are the hooks. Repeat.
- UGC: “Post your setup” — makers love sharing builds.

**Don’t:** Assume Rust knowledge; use jargon; ignore low-code path.

**Formats:** Comparison table, demo video, benchmark chart, migration story.

**Channels:** LangChain Discord, r/LocalLLaMA, Hugging Face, Perplexity/LMSYS.

**Strategy:**
