## Shareable Content Ideas

| Idea | Format | Hook | Best for |
|------|--------|------|----------|
| “I ran an AI assistant on a $10 board” | Post + photo/video | Surprise + specs | Reddit (r/raspberry_pi, r/arduino) |
| “3.4MB binary, <10ms startup” | Side-by-side screenshot | Size/speed wow factor | Twitter, Hacker News |
| “Rust vs Python vs TypeScript for AI agents” | Comparison table | Debate bait | Reddit, dev Twitter |
| “Telegram-controlled robot” | Short demo video | Visual, tangible | r/robotics, r/raspberry_pi |
| “No Node.js, no Python runtime — single binary” | One-liner + link | Simplicity sell | r/selfhosted, r/raspberry_pi |
| “<5MB RAM on 0.8GHz” | Benchmark chart | Edge cred | Makers, IoT devs |

---

## Viral Loops

1. **Reddit → Landing → GitHub:** Post in relevant sub, link to compare pages or quick-start; track stars/forks.
2. **Demo video → YouTube → Reddit/Twitter:** 60–90s “ZeroClaw on RPi” demo; cross-post.
3. **Benchmark share:** “Reproduce locally” CTA from benchmark; users post their own numbers (UGC).
4. **“Add your project”:** Ecosystem page invites PRs; contributors share their builds (social proof loop).

---

## Hooks That Work

- **Specs as flex:** “3.4MB,” “<10ms,” “<5MB RAM” — concrete, memorable.
- **Cost angle:** “Runs on $10 hardware” vs “Mac Mini $599.”
- **Anti-stack:** “No Node.js,” “No Pinecone,” “No Elasticsearch” — resonates with minimalists.
- **Visual:** Screenshot of `zeroclaw status` output, binary size, RAM usage.
- **Story:** “First AI assistant I could actually run on my Pi” — personal, relatable.

---

## Amplification

- **Influencer/creator:** Reach maker YouTubers, RPi educators; send dev board + one-pager.
- **Community first:** Answer questions in r/rust, r/raspberry_pi, r/selfhosted; link when relevant.
- **Repost loops:** Pin top Reddit/Twitter posts; feature in newsletter or “community highlights.”
