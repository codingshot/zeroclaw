# Raspberry Pi Outreach — ZeroClaw

Raspberry Pi communities, “sellout” (high-engagement) events, and tailored messaging. ZeroClaw’s sweet spot: edge AI on affordable hardware.

Last updated: **February 18, 2026**.

## Raspberry Pi Communities (Tiered)

### Tier 1 — Primary Targets

| Community | Size / activity | Best content | Notes |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------|-------|
| r/raspberry_pi | 1M+ members | “AI on Pi: 3.4MB binary, <5MB RAM” | Show-and-tell, how-to; avoid spam |
| r/raspberry_pi_projects | 200K+ | Project builds, “ZeroClaw + GPIO” | Project-focused |
| r/selfhosted | 500K+ | Self-hosted AI, no cloud | Strong fit for ZeroClaw |
| r/homelab | 1M+ | Homelab AI, lightweight services | Edge, low-resource angle |

### Tier 2 — Adjacent / Maker

| Community | Notes |
|-----------|------|
| r/arduino | Arduino as host; ZeroClaw binary on Pi/board |
| r/esp32 | ESP32 projects; ZeroClaw on companion Pi |
| r/homeautomation | Smart home + AI agent |
| r/RetroPie | Retro gaming Pi; “add AI assistant” angle |
| r/3Dprinting | Makers; “AI for your print farm” |

### Tier 3 — Developer / Rust

| Community | Notes |
|-----------|------|
| r/rust | Rust angle; trait-based, memory-safe |
| r/linux | Linux SBC, minimal binary |
| r/sysadmin | Ops, runbooks, lightweight agents |

## “Sellout” Events & Opportunities

**“Sellout” = high-engagement moments** where Pi communities are most active and receptive:

| Event / moment | Timing | Angle |
|----------------|--------|-------|
| Pi Day (March 14) | March | “Pi Day: Run AI on your Pi” post, promo |
| Raspberry Pi release | When new Pi launches | “Tested on Pi 5 / Zero 2” compatibility |
| Hackaday Prize | Annual | Submit ZeroClaw-powered project |
| r/raspberry_pi “What are you building?” threads | Ongoing | Participate, share when relevant |
| Maker Faire / local maker events | Regional | Booth, demo, one-pagers |
| Pi shortage → Pi available again | News cycle | “Now that Pi is back, try ZeroClaw” |
| “Lightweight alternatives” discussions | When someone asks | Suggest ZeroClaw (helpful, not pushy) |

## Messaging by Segment

**Casual Pi user:**
> “Run an AI assistant on your Pi. ZeroClaw: single binary, no Python/Node setup. Control from Telegram. <5MB RAM.”

**Maker / tinkerer:**
> “Add AI to your project. ZeroClaw runs on $10 boards. Expose GPIO, sensors, motors as tools. Rust, open source.”

**Self-hoster:**
> “Self-hosted AI agent. No cloud, no SaaS. ZeroClaw: 3.4MB binary, SQLite memory, 22+ providers.”

**Rust dev:**
> “Rust agent runtime for edge. Trait-based: add Provider, Channel, Tool, Peripheral. <10ms startup.”

## Content Checklist for RPi Outreach

- [ ] “ZeroClaw on Raspberry Pi in 15 min” tutorial (landing + docs)
- [ ] Benchmark: Pi 4 vs Pi 5 vs Zero 2 (RAM, startup)
- [ ] Demo video: Telegram → Pi GPIO (light, servo, etc.)
- [ ] One-pager PDF for maker events / booths
- [ ] r/raspberry_pi show-and-tell post (specs + link, no hype)
- [ ] Answer “lightweight AI on Pi” questions when they appear
