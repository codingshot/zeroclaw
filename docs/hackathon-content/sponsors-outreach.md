## Sponsor one-pager (copy for email or PDF)

**Event:** Build on ZeroClaw — 2-week hackathon  
**Dates:** [Start] – [End]  
**Format:** Hybrid (kickoff + demo live; build async; office hours 2–3x per week)

**What is ZeroClaw?**  
ZeroClaw is an open-source, Rust-based agent runtime that runs on $10 hardware (<5MB RAM, single binary). It supports 28+ LLM providers, Telegram/Discord/Slack/WhatsApp and more, and hardware peripherals (Raspberry Pi, Arduino, Nucleo). Developers extend it by implementing traits (Channel, Tool, Provider, Peripheral) and registering in the factory — no vendor lock-in.

**Who participates?**  
Developers, makers, students, and teams building agents, integrations, and edge/IoT projects. Tracks: New Channel, New Tool, New Provider, New Peripheral, Skill Pack, Observability, Security, Docs/DX, Wildcard. We also run optional themed tracks (e.g. x402/agentic payments, legal tech, edge).

**What we’re asking:**  
[Title / Track / Prize / Community] sponsorship. In return we offer [logo on all materials / track named after you / prize named by you / thank-you and logo on event page]. We expect [N] registrants and will publish winner highlights and a wrap-up post.

## What not to promise

- Don’t promise specific participant numbers unless you have data.
- Don’t commit to adding sponsor content (logo, link) inside the ZeroClaw codebase or official docs unless maintainers agree.
- Keep sponsor messaging neutral — “sponsor of this event” only, no implied endorsement of a token or product beyond that.
