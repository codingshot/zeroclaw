# Hackathon content folder

This folder holds **outreach and content** for the ZeroClaw hackathon: who to reach, how to message them, and what to send. Use it alongside the main [use-cases-and-hackathon-plan](../use-cases-and-hackathon-plan.md).

Last updated: **February 18, 2026**.

## Contents

| Doc | Audience | Use when |
|-----|----------|----------|
| [judges-outreach.md](judges-outreach.md) | Judges | Recruiting judges; onboarding; what they get; scoring and timing. |
| [sponsors-outreach.md](sponsors-outreach.md) | Sponsors | Sponsor one-pager; email templates; tiers; what not to promise. |
| [builder-segments.md](builder-segments.md) | Builders (by segment) | Tailored messaging for Rust devs, makers, legal tech, crypto, students, etc.; where they hang out. |
| [personas.md](personas.md) | Personas | Builder personas: goals, pain points, messaging hooks, and suggested tracks. |

## Quick use

- **Recruiting judges:** Use [judges-outreach.md](judges-outreach.md) — email template, commitment, scoring sheet link.
- **Recruiting sponsors:** Use [sponsors-outreach.md](sponsors-outreach.md) — one-pager, tier ask, follow-up.
- **Announcing to builders:** Use [builder-segments.md](builder-segments.md) to pick channels and [personas.md](personas.md) to tailor copy (e.g. “Rust devs” vs “makers” vs “legal tech”).
- **Creating track-specific promos:** Combine personas + segments — e.g. “Hardware track” → makers + Rust + r/raspberry_pi.
