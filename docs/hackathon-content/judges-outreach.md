## What judges do

- **Before demo day:** Receive judging packet (links to PRs, track, 1–2 sentence description, demo link) by end of Day 12.
- **Score submissions:** Use the [judge scoring sheet](../use-cases-and-hackathon-plan.md#216-judge-scoring-sheet-example) (functionality, quality, security, docs, originality); optional “judge’s pick” or “would merge.”
- **By Day 13 EOD:** Return scores so organizers can tally and prepare awards for Day 14.
- **Optional:** Join demo day (live or async) to ask one question per team or present a track award.

**Time ask:** ~1–2 hours total (review packet, score 5–15 submissions depending on track load). No requirement to attend live.

## Who to recruit

| Profile | Why they fit |
|---------|----------------|
| **Maintainers / core contributors** | Know the codebase and trait contracts; can judge “would merge” and correctness. |
| **Track-aligned experts** | E.g. someone who ships Rust channels for a living (Channel track); security reviewer (Security track); hardware tinkerer (Peripheral track). |
| **Sponsor representatives** | If a sponsor has “judge slot” in their tier; keeps them engaged and adds credibility. |
| **Past hackathon winners** | Community credibility; know what a good submission looks like. |
| **Educators / devrel** | Good at “best first PR” or “best demo”; clarity and onboarding. |

**Pool size:** 1–2 judges per track, or 3–5 pooled judges who score across tracks. For 9 tracks, aim for 5–9 people (some can cover 2 tracks).

Subject: ZeroClaw Hackathon — would you judge? (~1–2h, by [Day 13])

Hi [Name],

We’re running a 2-week “Build on ZeroClaw” hackathon [dates]. ZeroClaw is an open-source Rust agent runtime (runs on $10 hardware, 28+ providers, Telegram/Discord/hardware peripherals). We’re looking for judges to score submissions and optionally present a track award on demo day.

What we need from judges:
- Receive a judging packet by [Day 12] with links to each submission (PR, track, description, demo).
- Score each submission on functionality, quality, security, docs, and originality (rubric provided).
- Return scores by [Day 13] EOD so we can announce winners on [Day 14].
- Optional: join the [Day 14] demo session to ask one question per team or present an award.

Time: about 1–2 hours total. No need to attend live if your schedule doesn’t allow.

Tracks we’re filling: [e.g. New Channel, New Tool, New Peripheral, Security, Docs]. If you have a track preference, tell us.

Interested? Reply with a yes and your track preference (or “any”). We’ll send the criteria and scoring form once you’re confirmed.

## What judges get (no monetary)

- **Credit:** Named in wrap-up post, release notes, or thank-you slide (“Thanks to our judges: …”).
- **Early look:** See what the community builds; good for recruiting or product ideas.
- **Optional:** Logo or link if judge’s company is a sponsor (per sponsor tier).

Keep the ask light so judges don’t need budget approval; emphasize “community” and “visibility.”
